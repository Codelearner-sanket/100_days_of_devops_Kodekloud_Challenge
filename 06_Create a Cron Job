*******************************Day 6: Create a Cron Job***************************
Question :  The Nautilus system admins team has prepared scripts to automate several day-to-day tasks. They want them to be deployed on all app servers in Stratos DC on a set schedule. Before that they need to test similar functionality with a sample cron job. Therefore, perform the steps below:

a. Install cronie package on all Nautilus app servers and start crond service.

b. Add a cron */5 * * * * echo hello > /tmp/cron_text for root user.

Ans : 

Step A: Install & Start Cron Service

Login to each App Server (stapp01, stapp02, stapp03) , then switch to root.

sudo su -

Now install cronie (cron package):

yum install -y cronie   # for CentOS/RHEL-based

systemctl start crond
systemctl enable crond
systemctl status crond

Step B: Add Cron Job for Root

Edit rootâ€™s crontab:

crontab -e

Add this line:
*/5 * * * * echo hello > /tmp/cron_text


crontab -l

Verify Cron Job
Wait at least 5 minutes, then check:

cat /tmp/cron_text
