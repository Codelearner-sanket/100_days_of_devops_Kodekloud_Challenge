*****************************Day 25: Git Merge Branches***************************
The Nautilus application development team has been working on a project repository /opt/beta.git. This repo is cloned at /usr/src/kodekloudrepos on storage server in Stratos DC. They recently shared the following requirements with DevOps team:

Create a new branch nautilus in /usr/src/kodekloudrepos/beta repo from master and copy the /tmp/index.html file (present on storage server itself) into the repo. Further, add/commit this file in the new branch and merge back that branch into master branch. Finally, push the changes to the origin for both of the branches.

Solution : 


The task was:
ðŸ‘‰ Create a new branch nautilus, add a file, commit, merge it back to master, and push both branches.

Login to Storage Server
ssh natasha@ststor01
sudo su -

Step 1: Go to repo and check branch
cd /usr/src/kodekloudrepos/beta
git branch

Step 2: Create new branch nautilus
git checkout -b nautilus


Step 3: Copy the file into repo
cp /tmp/index.html .


Step 4: Add and commit the file
git add index.html
git commit -m "Added index.html file to nautilus branch"


Step 5: Push new branch to origin
git push origin nautilus
Sent nautilus branch (with the new file) to the central repo (/opt/beta.git).


Step 6: Merge into master
git checkout master
git merge nautilus

You went back to master branch and merged nautilus changes into it.
Now master also has index.html.


Step 7: Push master to origin
git push origin master

Step 8: Confirm branches
git branch -a
* master
  nautilus
  remotes/origin/master
  remotes/origin/nautilus
