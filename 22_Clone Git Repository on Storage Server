*****************************Day 22: Clone Git Repository on Storage Server***************************
DevOps team created a new Git repository last week; however, as of now no team is using it. The Nautilus application development team recently asked for a copy of that repo on Storage server in Stratos DC. Please clone the repo as per details shared below:

1. The repo that needs to be cloned is /opt/media.git

2. Clone this git repository under /usr/src/kodek loudrepos directory. Please do not try to make any changes in the repo.

Solution:


First SSH in to the storage server.

Bare git repository(A bare repository contains only the . git/ part, no files you can directly edit.) such as media.git found in the /opt folder.

Task is to clone the media.git to the folder /usr/src/kodekloudrepos folder.

In the kodeklourepos directory , clone the bare repository.
cd /usr/src/kodekloudrepos

git clone /opt/media.git

Check the .git folder present in the media folder after cloning to the kodekloudrepos folder.
